    "\n",
    "Alright‚Äîhere‚Äôs my best shot at the 2026 domestic (U.S./Canada) top-10, ranked by **full domestic grosses for movies released in 2026**. I‚Äôm leaning on what‚Äôs dominated the last decade (Marvel/Spider-Man, Nintendo/Illumination, Pixar, big holiday tentpoles) and on the current 2026 slate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My top-10 prediction (ranked)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avengers: Doomsday** ‚Äî *Dec 18, 2026* (Disney/Marvel). December ‚Äúevent‚Äù MCU movies tend to explode out of the gate and hold through January; Avengers has owned the domestic charts in prior cycles. If the date holds, this is the favorite. ([Deadline][1])\n",
    "2. **The Super Mario Galaxy Movie** ‚Äî *Apr 3, 2026* (Universal/Illumination). The first Mario did a monster \\$575M domestic; a spring date with long runway screams legs. ([Disney Movies][2])\n",
    "3. **Toy Story 5** ‚Äî *Jun 19, 2026* (Disney/Pixar). Four-quadrant, generational IP in a prime June slot; TS4 did \\$434M domestic pre-pandemic. ([IMDb][3])\n",
    "4. **Spider-Man: Brand New Day (Spider-Man 4)** ‚Äî *Jul 31, 2026* (Sony/Marvel). The most reliable non-Avatar brand domestically, landing late-July for IMAX runway. ([Hollywood Reporter][4])\n",
    "5. **Minions 3** ‚Äî *Jul 1, 2026* (Universal/Illumination). Despicable Me/Minions entries live in the \\$300‚Äì\\$400M domestic band and own July 4 playtime. ([Universal Pictures][5])\n",
    "6. **The Mandalorian & Grogu** ‚Äî *May 22, 2026* (Disney/Lucasfilm). Memorial Day + Star Wars + Grogu = huge family turnout and merch-powered awareness. ([Business Wire][6])\n",
    "7. **Shrek 5** ‚Äî *Dec 23, 2026* (Universal/DreamWorks). Christmas launch with a nostalgia juggernaut should leg into January/February; late release but massive total. ([Animation Magazine][7])\n",
    "8. **Moana (Live-Action)** ‚Äî *Jul 10, 2026* (Disney). Disney‚Äôs stronger live-action remakes (Lion King/Aladdin) show the ceiling; Moana‚Äôs music/cultural footprint is big. ([Wikipedia][8])\n",
    "9. **The Odyssey** ‚Äî *Jul 17, 2026* (Universal/Christopher Nolan). Nolan + IMAX in midsummer has become an event; Oppenheimer hit \\$329M domestic with adult appeal. ([Universal Pictures][9])\n",
    "10. **Supergirl** ‚Äî *Jun 26, 2026* (WB/DC Studios). If *Superman* (2025) plays well, this gets a halo; summer placement helps even with competition. ([Hollywood Reporter][10])\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this ordering?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pattern fit:** The last decade‚Äôs U.S. #1s are dominated by MCU/Spider-Man, Star Wars, and top-tier animation (Pixar/Illumination/Nintendo). These brands still convert at scale when dated well.\n",
    "* **Calendar strength:** April (Mario) offers clear playtime; late-June/July (Toy Story/Minions/Moana/Nolan/Spidey) is crowded, so I nudged family titles a hair below the absolute peaks to account for cannibalization; **December event** (Avengers, Shrek) tends to rocket to big totals counted to their release year.\n",
    "* **Risk notes:** If **Avengers: Doomsday** slips to 2027, I‚Äôd elevate **Mario** to #1, bump everything below up a slot, and slide **Street Fighter (Oct 16, 2026, Paramount/Legendary)** into the #10‚Äì#12 conversation depending on word of mouth. ([Reuters][11])\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence tiers (so you can judge my bet)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High:** Avengers, Mario, Toy Story, Spider-Man.\n",
    "* **Medium:** Minions, Mandalorian & Grogu, Moana, Nolan‚Äôs Odyssey.\n",
    "* **Lower (but still in):** Shrek (late-Dec launch volatility), Supergirl (new DCU still proving legs).\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Top 10 Predicted US Domestic Box Office Movies of 2026**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Avengers: Doomsday (December 18, 2026)** - $450-550 million domestic  \n",
    "Marvel's Avengers: Doomsday will be released on December 18, 2026, featuring Robert Downey Jr. returning as Doctor Doom and directed by the Russo Brothers. Given the massive success of previous Avengers films and the excitement around RDJ's return to the MCU, this should be the year's biggest hit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (April 3, 2026)** - $400-450 million domestic  \n",
    "The sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on April 3, 2026, with Chris Pratt returning to voice Mario. The original made over $1.3 billion worldwide, so the sequel should perform exceptionally well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Moana (Live-Action) (July 10, 2026)** - $350-400 million domestic  \n",
    "Moana is scheduled to be released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures in the United States on July 10, 2026, starring Catherine Laga'aia and Dwayne Johnson reprising his role as Maui. Disney's live-action remakes have been hugely successful, and this one has the advantage of The Rock's star power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Dune: Part Three (December 18, 2026)** - $300-350 million domestic  \n",
    "Dune: Part Three is scheduled to be released on December 18, 2026, with Timoth√©e Chalamet, Zendaya, Florence Pugh, Jason Momoa, and Josh Brolin returning. Given that Dune: Part Two earned $282,144,358 domestically, the conclusion should perform even better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Minions 3 (July 1, 2026)** - $280-320 million domestic  \n",
    "Illumination's \"Minions 3\" moves into that summer 2026 window from its planned June 30, 2027 date. The Minions franchise is incredibly reliable at the box office, and Despicable Me 4 earned $361,004,205 in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. The Mandalorian and Grogu (May 22, 2026)** - $250-300 million domestic  \n",
    "The Mandalorian and Grogu will be among the major May 2026 movie releases. This will be the first theatrical Star Wars film since Rise of Skywalker, and Baby Yoda's popularity should drive strong box office performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Jumanji 4 (December 2026)** - $200-250 million domestic  \n",
    "Dwayne Johnson movie (Jumanji 4) is among the huge releases for the holidays. The previous Jumanji films have been surprise box office successes, and Johnson's star power continues to draw audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping (November 2026)** - $180-220 million domestic  \n",
    "The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, starring Joseph Zada as a young Haymitch will revive the popular YA franchise. While YA adaptations have cooled, the Hunger Games brand remains strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Scream 7 (February 2026)** - $150-180 million domestic  \n",
    "director Kevin Williamson's Scream 7 will be among February 2026's releases. Horror sequels have been performing well, and the Scream franchise has loyal fans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Ice Age 6 (December 18, 2026)** - $140-170 million domestic  \n",
    "Disney has Ice Age 6 dated December 18, five days before Shrek 5 opens in theaters. Family animated films perform well during the holidays, though this franchise has seen diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key factors influencing these predictions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Franchise strength**: Most successful 2024 films were sequels/franchises (Inside Out 2, Deadpool & Wolverine, Despicable Me 4 topped the charts)\n",
    "- **Star power**: Dwayne Johnson appears in multiple predicted hits, similar to his consistent box office appeal\n",
    "- **Holiday releases**: December has proven successful for blockbusters like Avatar, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Aquaman\n",
    "- **Animation dominance**: Five of the most prominent animated film franchises will have new entries in 2026\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Shrek 5 has been delayed from December 2026 to June 30, 2027, removing it from 2026 contention."
